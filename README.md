- 👋 Hi, I’m @JasonS05
- 👀 I’m interested in coding because it's fun. Especially low-level stuff (brainfuck even) is fun to think about, but really a pain to work with, and I'm really just too lazy to touch most of the interesting low level stuff because it takes too much work.
- 🌱 I’m not currently learning anything, but I'd like to learn Rust some day.
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking to collaborate on anything.
- 📫 I don't have any means of reach besides my personal email address, which I'm not gonna give away. If you really need, go PM me on SoloLearn (profile name is "Jason Stone")
